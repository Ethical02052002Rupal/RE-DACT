Location of redact code: redactor->redact->REDACT

 The proposed solution, titled Redaction Toolkit, aims to
 revolutionize this process through the power of artificial intelligence and
 machine learning.This project is envisioned as a highly efficient, accurate,
 and scalable system that simplifies the traditionally labor-intensive redaction
 workflow into an automated, intelligent solution. By integrating computer
 vision techniques like the YOLO algorithm, natural language processing
 systems, and robust PDF parsing tools, the project addresses the critical need
 for a smart, multi-modal, and user-friendly redaction platform that ensures
 data security while maintaining document integrity
 
Flow of this system
-------------------
 1. Input Phase: The user uploads a document, image, or video file into
 the system interface.

 3. Preprocessing: The file is parsed and analyzed using AI/ML and NLP
 tools depending on the media type.

 5. Detection: Sensitive elements such as names, faces, license plates, or
 PII are identified using trained models (YOLO, Regex, NLP).

 7. Review & Customization: Users are given the option to confirm,
 modify, or add redaction zones.

 9. Redaction: The system permanently removes or masks the identified
 sensitive data from the content.

 11. Output Phase: A clean, redacted version of the original file is
 generated and made available for download.
